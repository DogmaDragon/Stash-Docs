Currently stash is supported in Unraid via the [Community Applications](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/38582-plug-in-community-applications/) plugin.

As of April 6, 2020 the Stash app is now published to the container directory as well. 
Please install and use StashApp with that template. 

Unraid specific support can be found [here](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/90861-support-stash-corneliousjd-repo/).

For users that want to try the development branch of stash you can change the repo to this one `stashapp/stash:development`.
