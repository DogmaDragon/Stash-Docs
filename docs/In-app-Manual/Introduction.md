Stash works by cataloging your media using the paths that you provide. Once you have [configured](http://localhost:9999/settings?tab=library){:target="_blank"} the locations where your media is stored, you can click the Scan button in [`Settings -> Tasks`](http://localhost:9999/settings?tab=tasks){:target="_blank"} and stash will begin scanning and importing your media into its library.

For the best experience, it is recommmended that after a scan is finished, that video previews and sprites are generated. You can do this in [`Settings -> Tasks`](http://localhost:9999/settings?tab=tasks){:target="_blank"}. Note that currently it is only possible to perform one task at a time and there is no task queue, so the Generate task should be performed after Scan is complete.

Once your media is imported, you are ready to begin creating Performers, Studios and Tags, and curating your content!
