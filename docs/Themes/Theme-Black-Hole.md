# Notes

Just a simple all black theme.<br>
Everything in this css is commented, so if you don't like something just remove it!<br>
Don't like the color of the border, or the border at all, change it or remove it!<br>
If you're not sure how DM me on Discord.

# Important changes
1. By default scrubber is hidden.<br>
2. By default hovering on performers images when checking them below a scene/gallery makes them bigger, useful if you're not really sure who the hell is that person!!! This is a little tricky when you have a lot of performers on an item but I manage to check them all. To achieve this I had to "break" tags, now they never to go a new line.<br>
3.  Made checkboxes, on scenes/galleries/etc., a little bigger so it's easier to click on them and not on the item itself.<br>
4. Removed transparency from logos when on scenes/etc., it's easier to see them and it's not a big deal since they disappear when you hover on an item to check it.<br>
5. You can set a custom background from an online image and yes you can use gifs but mind the size :)<br>
By default it's set to "contain" so if the image is extremely small, well you get the catch... shouldn't be a problem with bigger images.

Have fun and if in doubt you should find me on Discord!
