1. Run the executable (typically `stash-win.exe`). 
  - Running the app might present a security prompt since the binary isn't signed yet. Just click `More info` and then the `run anyway` button.
2. It should open a browser tab http://localhost:9999 to get started.
3. The program will show an icon in your notification area. You can access some quick links or quit the server from there.

{: .note }
Some Windows 11 versions might open Stash via terminal. You can bypass that by running the program as administrator or [use a shortcut to run it via conhost.exe](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/issues/2598){:target="_blank"}
